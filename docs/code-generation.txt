CODE GENERATION

Given a = b # c (where a is a register, b and c are arithmetic/logic
expressions of registers/constants, and # is an arithmetic/logic operation),
generate:

(Code for a = b)
(Code for t = c)
a = a # t (where t is a temporary register).


EXAMPLE

a = (b * c) + (d * e) =>
    a = b * c
    t = d * e
    a = a + t

x = (b*b) - ((4 * a) * c) =>
    x = b * b
    t = (4 * a) * c =>
        t = 4 * a
        t = t * c   <-- Is this what would happen, though?
    x = x - t
    
    
QUESTIONS

How many temporary registers do we need?
What happens with a = f(a) ?
