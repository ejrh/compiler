SOME NOTES ON THE COMPILER

LANGUAGE

A bit like C; except with string, variant and array data types, classes,
and garbage collection.

EXAMPLE

int factorial(int x)
{
    if (x <= 1)
        return 1;
    else
        return x * factorial(x - 1);
}

int main(int argc, var argv)
{
    int a = argv[1];
    int b = factorial(a);
    
    write("factorial of " . a . " = " . b . "\n");
    
    return 0;
}

int tree_size(pointer tree)
{
    int s = 0;
    
}

OUTPUT

C?  Intel assembly language, compatible with GNU asm?  Some made up assembly
language?
