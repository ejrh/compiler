NOTES ON GARBAGE COLLECTION

All variables in E are:

int
float
string
class<X>
array<X>

int, float and string variables are copied

class and array variables point to memory allocated with new.  They are copied
by reference.  Each block of allocated memory recalls how many variables
reference it.

When a class or array variable is no longer in scope (or its container is no
longer in scope), the reference count for the referred object is decremented.


EXAMPLE

int f(Complex c)
{
    Complex z;
    
    z = c;
}
